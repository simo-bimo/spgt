# SPGT: Small Plans for Good Times

A planner for Fully Observable Non-Deterministic (FOND) Planning domains with temporal goals specified in Pure-Past Linear Temporal Logic.

This planner is an extension of the [cfond-asp](https://github.com/ssardina-research/cfond-asp) planner, which supports goals specified in general boolean formulae, and PPLTL formulae.
